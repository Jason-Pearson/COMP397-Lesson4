//ALSO REMEMBER - 3 STEPS TO ADDING NEW MODULE (NEW CLASS) INTO YOUR CODE:
//1 - create class in its own .ts file
//2 - go to index.html, add the script - <script src="Scripts/objects/[insert file name here].js"></script>
//3 - add a reference path to the game.ts in order to use this class from this button.ts script on the game.ts script
